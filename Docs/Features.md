# Features

>Ultra Hardcore transforms your World of Warcraft experience through a carefully designed system of UI modifications and gameplay enhancements that recreate the tension and uncertainty of classic gaming.

## Core Difficulty Modifiers

- **No Health Bar Visibility**: The addon completely removes your character's health bar display, forcing you to rely on visual and audio cues to gauge your survival status. This fundamental change eliminates the safety net of precise health monitoring that modern players have come to depend on, recreating the uncertainty that defined early gaming experiences.

- **Progressive Death Indicator**: As your health decreases, the visible area of your screen progressively shrinks through a sophisticated overlay system. This creates an increasingly claustrophobic experience as you approach death, with the screen literally closing in around you. The effect serves both as a warning system and an immersive representation of your character's deteriorating condition.

- **Enemy Information Blackout**: 
All enemy nameplates, level indicators, and health information are systematically hidden. You'll face every encounter without knowing whether you're fighting a level 1 rabbit or a level 60 elite dragon. This uncertainty transforms every combat situation into a calculated risk, forcing you to rely on visual cues, mob behavior, and environmental context to assess threats. When the "Disable Nameplate Health" setting is enabled, nameplates display normally but health bars are stuck at 100% and level information is completely hidden for both allies and enemies. When disabled, nameplates function normally with full health and level information.

- **Combat Feedback Elimination**: Damage numbers, healing amounts, and combat text are completely removed from your interface. Success and failure in combat must be judged through character animations, sound effects, and the visual state of your targets. This creates a more immersive combat experience where you must pay attention to the actual fight rather than scrolling numbers.

- **Navigation Challenges**: The minimap is hidden by default, forcing you to navigate using landmarks, road signs, and environmental cues. This recreates the exploration experience of early MMORPGs where getting lost was a real possibility and geographical knowledge was a valuable skill.

## Immersive Punishment Systems

- **Critical Hit Screen Disruption**: When you receive a critical hit, your camera view spins in a random direction, simulating the disorienting effect of a devastating blow. This mechanic adds a layer of chaos to combat encounters and can potentially lead to dangerous situations if you lose track of your surroundings or additional enemies.

- **Dazed Visual Effects**: Being dazed triggers a blur overlay effect that obscures your vision, making it difficult to assess your surroundings or react to new threats. This visual impairment adds consequence to poor positioning and movement decisions.

- **Restricted Action Bar Access**: Your action bars are only visible when you're in a rested area (inn or major city). Outside of these safe zones, you must rely on memorized keybindings and muscle memory to execute abilities. This forces careful preparation and planning before venturing into dangerous areas.

## Social and Group Dynamics

- **Ally Health Indicators**: While your own health remains hidden, you can gauge your party members' condition through a color-coded healing icon system that appears above their heads. The icon gradually shifts from green to red as their health decreases, allowing for strategic healing decisions without precise health values.

- **Enhanced Party Information**: The addon provides improved party management tools while maintaining the hardcore aesthetic, including streamlined party formation and communication features designed for high-stakes group content.

- **Guild Integration**: Built-in guild channel functionality helps connect hardcore players and facilitates the formation of like-minded groups who appreciate the additional challenge layers.

## Advanced Challenge Systems

- **Dynamic Keybinding Disruption**: When critically hit, your keybindings temporarily scramble for several seconds, forcing you to adapt quickly or risk using the wrong abilities at crucial moments. This feature is currently in development and represents the cutting edge of hardcore difficulty modification.

- **Resource Management Audio Cues**: A heartbeat sound system provides audio feedback for resource regeneration during combat, replacing visual indicators with immersive audio cues that require active listening and interpretation.

- **Challenge Tracking System**: An integrated logbook tracks your completion of unique hardcore challenges, providing long-term goals and achievement recognition within the hardcore community. This system is actively being expanded with new challenge types and difficulty tiers.
