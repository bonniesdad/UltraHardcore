## Features

Ultra Hardcore transforms your World of Warcraft experience through a carefully designed system of UI modifications and gameplay enhancements that recreate the tension and uncertainty of classic gaming.



### Core Difficulty Modifiers

**No Health Bar Visibility**: The addon completely removes your character's health bar display, forcing you to rely on visual and audio cues to gauge your survival status. This fundamental change eliminates the safety net of precise health monitoring that modern players have come to depend on, recreating the uncertainty that defined early gaming experiences.

**Progressive Death Indicator**: As your health decreases, the visible area of your screen progressively shrinks through a sophisticated overlay system. This creates an increasingly claustrophobic experience as you approach death, with the screen literally closing in around you. The effect serves both as a warning system and an immersive representation of your character's deteriorating condition.

**Enemy Information Blackout**: All enemy nameplates, level indicators, and health information are systematically hidden. You'll face every encounter without knowing whether you're fighting a level 1 rabbit or a level 60 elite dragon. This uncertainty transforms every combat situation into a calculated risk, forcing you to rely on visual cues, mob behavior, and environmental context to assess threats. When the "Disable Nameplate Health" setting is enabled, nameplates display normally but health bars are stuck at 100% and level information is completely hidden for both allies and enemies. When disabled, nameplates function normally with full health and level information.

**Combat Feedback Elimination**: Damage numbers, healing amounts, and combat text are completely removed from your interface. Success and failure in combat must be judged through character animations, sound effects, and the visual state of your targets. This creates a more immersive combat experience where you must pay attention to the actual fight rather than scrolling numbers.

**Navigation Challenges**: The minimap is hidden by default, forcing you to navigate using landmarks, road signs, and environmental cues. This recreates the exploration experience of early MMORPGs where getting lost was a real possibility and geographical knowledge was a valuable skill.

### Immersive Punishment Systems

**Critical Hit Screen Disruption**: When you receive a critical hit, your camera view spins in a random direction, simulating the disorienting effect of a devastating blow. This mechanic adds a layer of chaos to combat encounters and can potentially lead to dangerous situations if you lose track of your surroundings or additional enemies.

**Dazed Visual Effects**: Being dazed triggers a blur overlay effect that obscures your vision, making it difficult to assess your surroundings or react to new threats. This visual impairment adds consequence to poor positioning and movement decisions.

**Restricted Action Bar Access**: Your action bars are only visible when you're in a rested area (inn or major city). Outside of these safe zones, you must rely on memorized keybindings and muscle memory to execute abilities. This forces careful preparation and planning before venturing into dangerous areas.

### Social and Group Dynamics

**Ally Health Indicators**: While your own health remains hidden, you can gauge your party members' condition through a color-coded healing icon system that appears above their heads. The icon gradually shifts from green to red as their health decreases, allowing for strategic healing decisions without precise health values.

**Enhanced Party Information**: The addon provides improved party management tools while maintaining the hardcore aesthetic, including streamlined party formation and communication features designed for high-stakes group content.

**Guild Integration**: Built-in guild channel functionality helps connect hardcore players and facilitates the formation of like-minded groups who appreciate the additional challenge layers.

### Advanced Challenge Systems

**Dynamic Keybinding Disruption**: When critically hit, your keybindings temporarily scramble for several seconds, forcing you to adapt quickly or risk using the wrong abilities at crucial moments. This feature is currently in development and represents the cutting edge of hardcore difficulty modification.

**Resource Management Audio Cues**: A heartbeat sound system provides audio feedback for resource regeneration during combat, replacing visual indicators with immersive audio cues that require active listening and interpretation.

**Challenge Tracking System**: An integrated logbook tracks your completion of unique hardcore challenges, providing long-term goals and achievement recognition within the hardcore community. This system is actively being expanded with new challenge types and difficulty tiers.

### System Requirements

- **World of Warcraft**: Classic Era (Vanilla) client
- **Interface Version**: 11507 or compatible
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux (any system supporting WoW Classic)
- **Disk Space**: Approximately 2.75 KB for core files plus additional space for saved variables
- **Memory**: Minimal impact on game performance (< 1MB RAM usage)

### Post-Installation Configuration

Upon first launch, Ultra Hardcore initializes with default settings optimized for maximum difficulty. However, you may want to customize certain aspects:

1. **Saved Variables**: Your preferences are automatically saved to `WTF\Account\[AccountName]\SavedVariables\UltraHardcoreDB.lua`
2. **Character-Specific Settings**: Some preferences are saved per-character for maximum flexibility

The addon requires no additional configuration to function at its core difficulty level, but advanced users can modify settings through the in-game interface or by editing the saved variables file directly.

### Core Framework Design

The addon utilizes an event-driven architecture centered around a main frame object that registers for specific World of Warcraft events. This design pattern ensures efficient resource usage and responsive behavior while maintaining compatibility with the game's security model.

```lua
-- Core frame initialization
UltraHardcore = CreateFrame('Frame')
UltraHardcore:RegisterEvent('ADDON_LOADED')
UltraHardcore:RegisterEvent('PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD')
UltraHardcore:RegisterEvent('UNIT_HEALTH_FREQUENT')
```

The main event handler implements a dispatch system that routes events to appropriate handler functions based on event type and current game state. This approach allows for clean code organization and efficient event processing.

### File Structure and Organization

The addon follows a hierarchical file organization that promotes maintainability and code reuse:

**Core Files**:
- `UltraHardcore.lua`: Main entry point and event dispatcher
- `UltraHardcore.toc`: Addon metadata and file loading order

**Modular Components**:
- `Functions/`: Core functionality modules
- `Settings/`: Configuration management
- `Constants/`: Game data and configuration constants
- `Sounds/`: Audio assets and sound management
- `Textures/`: Visual assets and overlay systems

### Event System Architecture

Ultra Hardcore implements an event handling system that responds to different World of Warcraft events:

**Player State Events**:
- `PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD`: Initializes addon state and applies UI modifications
- `PLAYER_UPDATE_RESTING`: Manages action bar visibility in rested areas
- `PLAYER_LEVEL_UP`: Triggers level-up specific functionality

**Combat Events**:
- `COMBAT_LOG_EVENT_UNFILTERED`: Processes combat actions for critical hit detection
- `UNIT_HEALTH_FREQUENT`: Monitors health changes for death indicator system

**UI Events**:
- `UNIT_AURA`: Manages buff/debuff related visual effects
- `GROUP_ROSTER_UPDATE`: Handles party composition changes
- `NAME_PLATE_UNIT_ADDED`: Controls enemy nameplate visibility

### Database Management System

The addon implements a saved variables system that persists user preferences and character statistics across game sessions. The database architecture supports both account-wide and character-specific data storage.

```lua
-- Database structure
UltraHardcoreDB = {
    global = {
        settings = { ... },
        statistics = { ... }
    },
    characters = {
        [characterKey] = {
            preferences = { ... },
            achievements = { ... }
        }
    }
}
```

**Data Persistence Features**:
- Automatic saving on significant events
- Character-specific preference tracking

Ultra Hardcore provides configuration options that allow players to customize their hardcore experience while maintaining the core challenge philosophy. The configuration system is designed to be both powerful for advanced users and accessible for those who prefer simple setup.

### Global Settings Overview

The addon's behavior is controlled through a comprehensive global settings object that manages all aspects of the hardcore experience:

```lua
GLOBAL_SETTINGS = {
    hidePlayerFrame = true,        -- Remove health bar visibility
    hideMinimap = true,           -- Hide minimap for navigation challenge
    hideTargetFrame = true,       -- Hide target information
    hideTargetTooltip = true,     -- Remove target tooltips
    showTunnelVision = true,      -- Enable death indicator screen effect
    showDazedEffect = true,       -- Enable dazed blur overlay
    showCritScreenMoveEffect = true, -- Enable critical hit screen rotation
    hideActionBars = false,       -- Control action bar visibility (rested areas only)
    hideGroupHealth = true,       -- Hide party member health bars
    hideUIErrors = true          -- Remove UI error messages
}
```

### Runtime Configuration Commands

Ultra Hardcore supports several slash commands for real-time configuration adjustment:

**Primary Commands**:
- `/bonnie`: Toggles the Bonnie resource indicator visibility
- `/uhc help`: Displays available commands and current settings
- `/uhc reset`: Restores all settings to default hardcore values
- `/uhc status`: Shows current configuration state and active features

### Advanced Configuration Options

**Death Indicator Sensitivity**: The progressive screen darkening effect can be fine-tuned through health percentage thresholds:

```lua
-- Death indicator activation points
if healthPercent <= 20 then
    ApplyDeathIndicatorChange(10)  -- Maximum darkness
elseif healthPercent <= 40 then
    ApplyDeathIndicatorChange(14)  -- Heavy darkening
elseif healthPercent <= 60 then
    ApplyDeathIndicatorChange(9)   -- Moderate darkening
elseif healthPercent <= 80 then
    ApplyDeathIndicatorChange(4)   -- Light darkening
end
```

**Critical Hit Screen Effects**: The screen rotation intensity and duration can be customized:

```lua
-- Screen rotation parameters
local rotationIntensity = 45      -- Degrees of rotation
local rotationDuration = 2.5      -- Seconds of effect
local recoverySpeed = 1.2         -- Return to normal speed
```

**Action Bar Visibility Rules**: The rested area detection system supports custom location definitions:

```lua
-- Rested area detection
local restedZones = {
    "Stormwind City",
    "Ironforge", 
    "Darnassus",
    "Orgrimmar",
    "Thunder Bluff",
    "Undercity"
}
```

### Saved Variables Configuration

Ultra Hardcore automatically persists configuration changes through World of Warcraft's saved variables system. The configuration file is located at:

```
WTF\Account\[AccountName]\SavedVariables\UltraHardcoreDB.lua
```

**Configuration File Structure**:
```lua
UltraHardcoreDB = {
    ["global"] = {
        ["settings"] = {
            ["difficultyLevel"] = 3,
            ["enableExperimentalFeatures"] = false,
            ["audioFeedbackEnabled"] = true,
            ["visualEffectsIntensity"] = 1.0
        },
        ["statistics"] = {
            ["totalDeaths"] = 0,
            ["criticalHitsReceived"] = 0,
            ["timePlayedHardcore"] = 0
        }
    },
    ["characters"] = {
        ["RealmName-CharacterName"] = {
            ["preferences"] = {
                ["resourceIndicatorVisible"] = false,
                ["customKeybindings"] = { ... }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

Ultra Hardcore is designed to be robust and reliable, but the complex nature of World of Warcraft addon interactions can occasionally lead to issues. This comprehensive troubleshooting guide addresses common problems and provides systematic solutions for resolving conflicts and performance issues.

### Common Installation Issues

**Addon Not Loading**
If Ultra Hardcore doesn't appear in your addon list or fails to load, follow these diagnostic steps:

1. **Verify File Structure**: Ensure the addon folder is named exactly "UltraHardcore" and contains the `UltraHardcore.toc` file. The complete path should be `Interface\AddOns\UltraHardcore\UltraHardcore.toc`.

2. **Check Interface Version**: While Ultra Hardcore is designed to be forward-compatible, significant game updates may require interface version updates. The addon will still function with "out of date" warnings.

3. **Validate File Integrity**: Re-download the addon if files appear corrupted. Incomplete downloads or extraction errors can prevent proper loading.

4. **Clear WoW Cache**: Delete the `Cache` folder in your World of Warcraft directory to force the client to rebuild addon information.

**Features Not Working**
When specific Ultra Hardcore features fail to activate:

1. **Confirm Addon Enabled**: Verify the addon is checked in the character selection addon list and shows as loaded in-game.

2. **Check for Error Messages**: Enable Lua error display (`/console scriptErrors 1`) to identify specific error messages that might indicate the problem.

3. **Test Core Commands**: Use `/bonnie` to verify basic addon functionality. If this command doesn't work, the addon isn't properly loaded.

4. **Review Saved Variables**: Corrupted saved variables can prevent proper initialization. Delete `UltraHardcoreDB.lua` from your SavedVariables folder to reset to defaults.

### Performance and Compatibility Issues

**Frame Rate Drops**
Ultra Hardcore is optimized for minimal performance impact, but certain configurations or conflicts can cause frame rate issues:

1. **Monitor Resource Usage**: Use `/frameratemonitor` or similar tools to identify when frame rate drops occur in relation to Ultra Hardcore features.

2. **Adjust Visual Effects**: Reduce the frequency of death indicator updates or disable experimental features that may be causing performance issues.

3. **Check for Conflicts**: Disable other UI addons temporarily to isolate whether conflicts are causing performance problems.

4. **Update Graphics Drivers**: Ensure your graphics drivers are current, as some visual effects may interact poorly with outdated drivers.

**Addon Conflicts**
Ultra Hardcore is designed to coexist with most addons, but conflicts can occur:

**Common Conflict Sources**:
- **UI Replacement Addons**: ElvUI, Bartender, and similar comprehensive UI replacements may conflict with Ultra Hardcore's interface modifications
- **Combat Addons**: Damage meters and combat analysis tools may interfere with the hidden damage text feature
- **Nameplate Addons**: Custom nameplate addons may conflict with Ultra Hardcore's nameplate hiding functionality

**Conflict Resolution Process**:
1. **Identify Conflicting Addon**: Disable addons one by one to isolate which addon is causing conflicts
2. **Check Load Order**: Ensure Ultra Hardcore loads after conflicting addons by modifying the TOC file if necessary
3. **Configure Compatibility**: Many conflicts can be resolved by configuring the conflicting addon to avoid overlapping functionality
4. **Report Compatibility Issues**: Submit detailed conflict reports to help improve future compatibility

### Visual Effect Problems

**Death Indicator Not Appearing**
The progressive screen darkening effect is a core Ultra Hardcore feature that should activate automatically:

1. **Verify Health Detection**: Ensure the addon can properly detect your health status by checking that other health-related features work
2. **Check Graphics Settings**: Some graphics configurations may interfere with overlay rendering
3. **Test in Different Zones**: Certain zones or situations may affect overlay functionality
4. **Reset Visual Settings**: Use `/uhc reset` to restore default visual effect settings

**Screen Rotation Issues**
Critical hit screen rotation effects may malfunction under certain conditions:

1. **Camera Settings**: Ensure your camera settings allow for programmatic rotation
2. **Input Conflicts**: Some input modification addons may interfere with camera control
3. **Hardware Acceleration**: Graphics hardware acceleration issues can affect smooth rotation effects

**Overlay Persistence**
Visual overlays that don't clear properly can obstruct gameplay:

1. **Manual Overlay Clearing**: Use `/uhc clearoverlays` to manually remove stuck overlays
2. **Restart UI**: `/reload` will reset all visual effects and clear persistent overlays
3. **Check for Memory Leaks**: Persistent overlays may indicate memory management issues that require addon restart

### Configuration and Settings Issues

**Settings Not Saving**
Configuration changes that don't persist between sessions:

1. **File Permissions**: Ensure World of Warcraft has write permissions to the SavedVariables directory
2. **Disk Space**: Insufficient disk space can prevent saved variable updates
3. **File Corruption**: Delete and recreate the UltraHardcoreDB.lua file to resolve corruption issues
4. **Multiple WoW Installations**: Verify you're modifying settings in the correct WoW installation directory

**Command Not Recognized**
Slash commands that don't respond properly:

1. **Verify Syntax**: Ensure commands are typed exactly as documented (case-sensitive)
2. **Check Addon Loading**: Commands won't work if the addon hasn't loaded properly
3. **Clear Chat Cache**: Sometimes chat command registration can be delayed or fail

### Advanced Troubleshooting

**Debug Mode Activation**
For complex issues, enable debug mode to gather detailed diagnostic information:

```lua
-- Enable comprehensive debugging
/run GLOBAL_SETTINGS.debugMode = true
/run GLOBAL_SETTINGS.verboseLogging = true
/reload
```

**Log File Analysis**
Ultra Hardcore generates detailed logs when debug mode is enabled:

1. **Locate Log Files**: Debug logs are written to the SavedVariables directory
2. **Analyze Error Patterns**: Look for recurring errors or warnings that might indicate the root cause
3. **Timestamp Correlation**: Match error timestamps with when problems occur in-game

**Memory Usage Monitoring**
Monitor addon memory usage to identify potential memory leaks:

```lua
-- Check addon memory usage
/run local mem = GetAddOnMemoryUsage("UltraHardcore"); print("UHC Memory: " .. mem .. " KB")
```
