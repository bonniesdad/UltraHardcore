# Contributing

>Ultra Hardcore thrives on community contributions from developers, testers, and hardcore gaming enthusiasts who share our vision of creating the ultimate challenging World of Warcraft experience. We welcome contributions of all types, from code improvements to documentation enhancements to gameplay suggestions.

## Ways to Contribute

**Code Contributions**: Help improve the addon's functionality, performance, and compatibility. Whether you're fixing bugs, implementing new features, or optimizing existing code, your programming skills can make Ultra Hardcore even better.

**Testing and Quality Assurance**: Test the addon across different scenarios, character classes, and game situations. Report bugs, edge cases, and compatibility issues to help maintain the addon's stability and reliability.

**Documentation**: Improve user guides, API documentation, code comments, and help resources. Clear documentation is essential for helping new users understand and adopt the hardcore gaming philosophy.

**Feature Design**: Propose new hardcore mechanics, visual effects, and challenge systems that align with the addon's philosophy of creating authentic difficulty without compromising game integrity.

**Community Support**: Help other users in discussions, provide troubleshooting assistance, and share your hardcore gaming experiences to build a stronger community around challenging gameplay.

## Getting Started with Contributions

**Join the Community**: Connect with other contributors through our Discord server where we discuss development priorities, share ideas, and coordinate efforts. The community provides valuable feedback and helps maintain the addon's direction.

**Understand the Philosophy**: Ultra Hardcore is built around the principle of creating authentic difficulty through information limitation and consequence amplification, not through artificial stat modifications or game-breaking changes. All contributions should align with this core philosophy.

**Review Existing Issues**: Check the GitHub issues page for bug reports, feature requests, and ongoing discussions. Many contributions start by addressing existing problems or implementing requested features.

**Start Small**: New contributors are encouraged to begin with smaller tasks like documentation improvements, minor bug fixes, or code cleanup before tackling major features.

## Contribution Process

**1. Discussion and Planning**
Before implementing significant changes, open an issue to discuss your ideas with the community and maintainers. This ensures your contribution aligns with project goals and prevents duplicate work.

**2. Development Setup**
Follow the development environment setup instructions in the Development section. Ensure you can build, test, and run the addon locally before making changes.

**3. Implementation**
Write clean, well-documented code that follows the project's coding standards. Include comprehensive comments explaining complex logic and ensure your changes don't break existing functionality.

**4. Testing**
Thoroughly test your changes across different scenarios. Include both automated tests where applicable and manual testing in various game situations.

**5. Documentation**
Update relevant documentation, including code comments, user guides, and API documentation. Ensure other developers and users can understand and use your contributions.

**6. Pull Request Submission**
Submit a detailed pull request with a clear description of your changes, the problem they solve, and how they've been tested. Include screenshots or videos for visual changes.

## Code Contribution Guidelines

**Coding Standards**: Follow the established Lua coding conventions used throughout the project. Use consistent indentation, meaningful variable names, and appropriate commenting.

**Performance Considerations**: World of Warcraft addons must be highly optimized to avoid impacting game performance. Consider memory usage, CPU efficiency, and frame rate impact when implementing features.

**Security and Compatibility**: Ensure your code doesn't introduce security vulnerabilities or compatibility issues with other addons. Follow Blizzard's addon development guidelines and avoid protected function modifications.

**Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling that gracefully manages unexpected situations without crashing the addon or affecting the game client.

## Testing Guidelines

**Functional Testing**: Verify that new features work correctly across different character classes, levels, and game scenarios. Test edge cases and unusual situations that might not be immediately obvious.

**Performance Testing**: Monitor the addon's impact on game performance, especially during intensive scenarios like raids or large-scale PvP battles.

**Compatibility Testing**: Ensure your changes don't conflict with popular addons that users commonly run alongside Ultra Hardcore.

**Regression Testing**: Verify that your changes don't break existing functionality or introduce new bugs in previously working features.

## Documentation Standards

**Code Documentation**: Include comprehensive comments explaining the purpose, parameters, and return values of functions. Document complex algorithms and non-obvious implementation decisions.

**User Documentation**: Write clear, step-by-step instructions for new features. Include examples and screenshots where helpful.

**API Documentation**: Maintain accurate and complete API documentation for functions that other developers might use.

**Changelog Maintenance**: Document all changes in the project changelog, including bug fixes, new features, and breaking changes.

## Community Guidelines

**Respectful Communication**: Maintain a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors regardless of experience level or background.

**Constructive Feedback**: Provide helpful, specific feedback on contributions. Focus on the code and ideas rather than personal criticism.

**Collaborative Problem Solving**: Work together to find the best solutions to challenges. Different perspectives and approaches often lead to better outcomes.

**Knowledge Sharing**: Share your expertise and learn from others. The hardcore gaming community benefits when knowledge and techniques are shared openly.

## Recognition and Attribution

**Contributor Recognition**: All contributors are acknowledged in the project's credits and changelog. Significant contributions may be highlighted in release notes and community announcements.

**Authorship**: Code contributions are attributed to their authors through Git commit history and contributor lists.

**Community Appreciation**: The Ultra Hardcore community regularly celebrates and thanks contributors for their efforts in making the addon better.

>Contributing to Ultra Hardcore is more than just writing code - it's about joining a community dedicated to preserving and enhancing the challenging, immersive gaming experiences that made classic MMORPGs special. Every contribution, no matter how small, helps maintain and improve this unique approach to World of Warcraft gameplay.
